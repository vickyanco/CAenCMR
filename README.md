Deep Learning-based identification of Cardiac Amyloidosis in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated a remarkable ability to recognize anatomical structures with significantly greater efficiency than human experts (Falconi et al., n.d.). Moreover, machine learning approaches are fundamental in many cardiovascular imaging acquisition and processing algorithms routinely used (Henglin et al., 2017).
The aim is to develop an AI system capable of identifying the presence of Cardiac Amyloidosis (CA) in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scans. CA is a rare but potentially fatal disease, and early diagnosis is crucial for improving treatment outcomes (Wechalekar et al., 2016). Therefore, the goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time to diagnosis.
CMR is a non-invasive technique that provides detailed information about the anatomy, function, and tissue characterization of the myocardium. It is particularly useful in diagnosing infiltrative diseases like amyloidosis, where amyloid deposits cause specific detectable characteristics. The use of advanced imaging techniques such as T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement allows for the detection of amyloid infiltration with high sensitivity and specificity, thereby improving early diagnostic capability (Valles, 2019).
In this way, after further testing, this system could be introduced into a magnetic resonance imaging study visualization interface, creating a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS). This system would provide healthcare personnel with automated suggestions on the need for complementary studies to confirm or rule out the presence of cardiac amyloidosis, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical efficiency.
